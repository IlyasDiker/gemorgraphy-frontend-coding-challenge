# gemogprahy-coding-challenge

This is my application for the frontend coding challenge for Gemogpraphy.
## Why i used Vuejs: 
I used VueJs cuz i like it and it's clean. and i preffer working with html directives...

I created everything myself no copy-pasted code from internet or bootstrap all the styles are mine hade lot of fun making this mini project.

## NOTE - my experience with gemography
If you're going to apply for gemography and found my repo and decided to get inspired from my work, i got rejected on the first try and then i been told to reaply the next 3 months, and they did not specify what was wrong with my code. and then another 3 months, i'm soory if someone from gemography reads this my experience with gemography was just a waste of time. just so you can expect this it's not that different from a classic hiring proccess.
