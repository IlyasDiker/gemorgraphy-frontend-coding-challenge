# gemogprahy-coding-challenge

This is my application for the frontend coding challenge for Gemogpraphy.
## Why i used Vuejs: 
I used VueJs cuz i like it and it's clean. and i preffer working with html directives...

I created everything myself no copy-pasted code from internet or bootstrap all the styles are mine hade lot of fun making this mini project.

## NOTE - my experience with gemography
If you're going to apply for gemography and found my repo and decided to get inspired from my work, Don't waste you're time i got rejected ðŸ˜‚
, they will ask you to wait for 3 months and then re-apply, just don't waste you're time if you're really looking for a job.
